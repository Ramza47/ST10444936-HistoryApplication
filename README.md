> to provide a consistent experience for all users. The app does not
> have unnecessary elements. The design is clean and focuses on the
> essential content to prevent users for overwhelming with too much
> information displayed. However, within the gesture support, there is
> incorporate intuitive gestures such as swiping and pinching to perform
> actions within the app. The app can be accessed offline for users to
> access historical content even without internet connection.
>
> **Content prioritisation:** Yes, there is relevance which prioritize

> size and spacing. No fancy fonts or small text have been added which
> could strain the user\`s eyes. Which this adds up to the intuitive
> design of the app. The app does not have several images, videos to
> complement the text. This can help bring history to life and make it

>
> **Hand position controls:** Yes, As stated in the Intuitive design, I
> made sure the buttons are well easy navigated and structured
> correctly, swiping, or taping to be used by the user and identifiable.
>
> **Images:** This image conveys a narrative or tell stories without
> words but the image I have chosen, it enhances the storytelling aspect
> of the environment. The image has a cool background nostalgic feeling,
> evokes a certain mood and it reflects to the user\`s interests,
> memories, or feelings, adding a distinctive touch to the space appeal.
> However, it holds a significance relevance which also reflects themes
> or intends the user. The image is at the center which it will draw the
> user\`s attention after opening the app, the placement serves a
> deliberate purpose. It draws a composition, or overall quality, making
> it a fitting choice for the location.
